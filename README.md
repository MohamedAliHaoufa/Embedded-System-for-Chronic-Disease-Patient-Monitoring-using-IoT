# Embedded-System-for-Chronic-Disease-Patient-Monitoring-using-IoT

<!--
This project aims to develop an embedded system that monitors chronic disease patients who need frequent medical check-ups.

This embedded system uses a Raspberry Pi 4b to gather data from several sensors installed in patients' bodies, and their data is constantly saved, analyzed and processed to extract vital details about their health and transfer it safely using MQTT protocol with the help of security encryption (AES Algorithm) to the IoT cloud where it is organized into an interface making it easier to use and understand, which allows users like doctors to easily access patientsâ€™ data and observing their health state from any place in the world. 

To enhance the functionality of the system, a warning system (Email/SMS) has been integrated into the IoT platform, which warns the doctor when the patient enters an abnormal state.

The budget and the outcome of this project are reasonable compared to what the patients pay for their Regular medical check-ups.

The project aims to develop an innovative embedded system tailored for monitoring chronic disease patients who require frequent medical assessments. Utilizing a Raspberry Pi 4b alongside various sensors integrated into patients' bodies, the system continuously gathers, analyzes, and processes health-related data. This data is meticulously scrutinized to extract crucial insights, which are then securely transmitted to the IoT cloud through robust encryption protocols (MQTT protocol with AES encryption). 

The system further organizes this data into an intuitive interface, facilitating easy access and comprehension for medical professionals, thereby enabling remote patient monitoring from any global location. Additionally, the system boasts an advanced warning mechanism embedded within the IoT platform. This feature proactively notifies healthcare providers of any deviations from the norm in patients' health parameters, empowering them to promptly intervene and ensure optimal patient care and outcomes. Although the integration of machine learning was deferred for future developments due to time constraints, the groundwork laid during this project has provided valuable insights into addressing critical challenges in technology-driven healthcare.
